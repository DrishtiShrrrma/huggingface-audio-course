# Challenges - ASR

1. Joint Knowledge Requirements: Understanding both audio and text.
2. Background Noise: Interference from extraneous sounds can make recognition difficult.
3. Different Accents: Variability in accents can complicate understanding.
4. Non-Acoustic Characters: Characters in written text that donâ€™t have an acoustic sound (e.g., punctuation) are challenging to infer from audio.
5. Variability in Speaker Characteristics: Differences in pitch, tone, and speech speed among individuals.
6. Language and Dialect Variations: Challenges arising from different languages and dialects.
7. Homophones: Difficulty in distinguishing words that sound the same but have different meanings or spellings.
8. Coarticulation: Overlapping adjacent phonemes make them hard to separate and recognize.
9. Reverberation: Reflection of sound off surfaces can distort the signal.
10. Multi-Speaker Environments: Recognizing speech from multiple speakers talking simultaneously.
11. Emotion and Stress in Speech: Altered pronunciation due to emotional state or stress.
12. Low-Resolution Audio: Hindrance due to poor quality or low-resolution audio.
