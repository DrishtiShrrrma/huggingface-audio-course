Audio:
1. Real-world signal ---> analog or continuous
2. Audio can be stored in analog + digital format
3. Analog Storage Medium: Vinyl records or cassette tapes
4. In most modern systems, audio is converted from analog ---> digital (ADC): for ease of storage, transmission, and manipulation (digital processing)


Analog signal: Continuous, smooth, uninterrupted

Discrete signal: Analog signals sampled at specific intervals ( hence exist at distinct points in time), but the amplitude of the signal can still take any value.

Digital signal: Discrete signals whose amplitude can take on only a finite number of values (usually integers)

Note: The process of converting an audio signal from the analog domain to digital involves two main steps: Sampling and Quantization (pulse code modulation, etc)
